# SeqModeling-CafeQABot

# Sequence Modeling Project: Cafe Chatbot

This project focuses on building a chatbot for a cafe using sequence modeling techniques. The chatbot is designed to interact with customers and answer their queries related to the cafe's menu, prices, recommendations, and other relevant information.

# The project involves the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, re, and scikit-learn for data processing and modeling.

2. Dataset download: The dataset containing conversations for training the chatbot is downloaded from Kaggle.

3. Data preparation: The dataset is read from a CSV file and cleaned by removing special characters. Start and end tokens are added to each sentence for sequence modeling. The data is visualized through histograms.

4. Data preprocessing: The sentences are tokenized using the Keras Tokenizer, and padding is applied to make the sequences of equal length.

5. Model architecture: A sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism is built using TensorFlow. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, and it utilizes attention to improve the quality of responses.

6. Model training: The model is trained on the preprocessed data using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The training progress is monitored and evaluated to ensure model performance.

7. Chatbot implementation: The trained model is used to implement a chatbot interface. Users can interact with the chatbot by inputting questions or queries, and the chatbot responds with relevant answers based on the learned patterns from the training data.

8. Deployment: The chatbot can be deployed on different platforms, such as a web application or messaging platforms, to provide a convenient and interactive experience for cafe customers.

The project aims to showcase the use of sequence modeling techniques for building a chatbot and provide a practical application in the context of a cafe. It demonstrates how natural language processing and deep learning can be combined to create an intelligent conversational agent.
